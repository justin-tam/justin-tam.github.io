              I sit here under the night sky.
              <br>
              How many times did I struggle for a better tomorrow?
              <br>
              How many days and nights did I starve so that we could survive?
              <br>
              Not a word. Not a sound. Nothing for the knight who stood alone against the darkness.
              <br>
              Aye. I'll take that drink. Another sip of that bittersweet ale.
              <br>
              Was it just a moment? A memory to be stored or forgotten?
              <br>
              No.
              <br>
              I'm drowning. Drowning in the darkness. Your darkness.
              <br>
              You said you didn't know... Until you did. Ha!
              <br>
              Just pass me another glass of that sweet melancholy.
