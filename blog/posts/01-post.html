            <p>
              <i>Nerves</i>, I thought as I cleared my throat and tightened my tie. <i>Nerves.</i>
               I grasped the old bronze doorknobs and twisted,
               taking one last deep breath before passing through those familiar chapel doors.
               <i>The same doors we ran through as children</i>, I thought, managing a strained grin.
            </p>
            <p>
              A dozen or so people turned and stared as I walked down the aisle.
               A few I recognized, others I didn't. I looked to the stage where your best friends
               and sister watched me, their faces a mixture of pity, concern, and disapproval.
               I tried to smile as I stepped carefully towards the altar, each step dragging more than the last.
               The weight in my heart felt a hundred pounds heavier.
               <i>This must have been how Frodo felt as he marched dutifully towards Mount Doom.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              And then I was there, standing beside the altar, in front of the groomsmen and assembled guests.
               I barely noticed when your cousin dropped her flower basket, scooped up a handful of rose petals,
               and continued down the aisle. My eyes were fixed on the entrance. On you.
            </p>
            <p>
              The music started up. <i>Pachelbel, Canon in D,</i> I thought with a smile.
               <i>How many times did we play that song together during our orchestra days?</i>
               The thought sped away as the doors opened, revealing your lovely face, your beautiful dress,
               your perfect smile. I held my breath as you stepped forward with your dad.
               Your curly dark hair cascaded down your shoulders, contrasting with your flowery white dress.
               Your curls bobbed with each step. You were so graceful, as if you were floating rather than
               walking down the aisle. Your father whispered something before helping you up the stairs and sitting down.
            </p>
            <p>
              I grit my jaw as I looked up at your face, so close that I could reach up and touch you, caress you.
               Your smile grew twice as big. My stomach lurched forward as Pastor Fred spoke. <i>You're my best friend,</i>
               I thought. <i>My one true love.</i> "I do," you said through restrained tears. "Ring please,"
               the pastor whispered towards me. "Ring!" he whispered again, harsher this time.
               I snapped out of my reverie and grasped the tiny symbol of your love, your union,
               and handed it to the groom. He smiled and winked back at me. I smiled back through clenched teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
              You smiled briefly as our eyes crossed. And then your gaze returned to your husband-to-be.
               Pastor Fred said his bit. Your to-be slid that symbol of your love, my burden for the past
               twenty four hours, onto your slender fingers. And then Fred said those magic words,
               "By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride."
               Everything slowed down. Your cherry lips puckered. Y'all leaned in. I stared down at my feet as
               cheers erupted from the assembly, like some glorious triumph to my misery. And then y'all were
               gone, marching back up the aisle, and all I could think of was that damn Pachelbel's Canon..
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>There goes my bride, all dressed in white. There goes my heart, towards happier times.</i>
