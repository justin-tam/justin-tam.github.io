              A Letter to my Child.

            <p>
              My dearest Child, You are my everything.
              <br>
              You are my heart, You are my soul.
              <br>
              You are the embodiment of my ambitions and my love.
            </p>

            <p>
              Princes, Kings, and Emperors have bowed before you.
              <br>
              Men, women, boys, and girls have worshiped you.
              <br>
              And yet their praise falls short.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've climbed the highest mountains.
              <br>
              And dived beneath the deepest oceans.
              <br>
              I've seen everything and met everyone.
              <br>
              And yet you have surpassed them all.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was there when you came.
              <br>
              Screaming and crying into this world.
              <br>
              And I will see you when that world ends.
              <br>
              But for now, let me hold you.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are beautiful.
              <br>
              No words, no pictures, no song, food, nor touch can show it.
              <br>
              You are beautiful.
              <br>
              And you always will be.
            </p>
