              Let's believe we will say hello again, because some goodbyes are harder to accept than others.

                    <p>
              Every time I say goodbye, I let myself believe that when we say hello again, we will be just as good friends as we were then.
            </p>
            <p>
              But some goodbyes will be forever. And some friendships will become fond memories.
            </p>
            <p>
              But I think it's better that way, to let old friendships settle into happy memories rather than forced commitments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because when we meet again, we will both be different people. And with a certainty, we will be better off for the time apart - though we don't know it yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              So to my dearest one, goodbye. Let's believe we will say hello again, because some goodbyes are harder to accept than others.
